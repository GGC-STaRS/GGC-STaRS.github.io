Dear Colleagues,

As faculty and research scientists, we all recognize the importance of providing undergraduate research experiences for our students. The STaRS event is particularly important as it provides a venue for our students to showcase the outcomes of this high-impact practice - critical thinking, problem-solving, data analysis, oral communication, and community building to name a few. The Spring 2024 STaRS event will be many of our students’ very first opportunity to present the results of a significant amount of work to their professors and peers, in a supportive and celebratory environment. In addition, STaRS continues to represent our best opportunity to show campus leaders and colleagues in other departments the truly outstanding science that GGC students and faculty are doing every day.

This year is especially important, as I’ve invited SST Corporate Affiliate Partners and Board of Visitor members to serve as guest judges for the poster presentations. They are excited to engage with our talented students!

Because of all of these factors, I am asking each and every faculty member who has conducted research with students to encourage your students to present their research at STaRS. We have plenty of space remaining to showcase your students’ work, and the STaRS Committee has extended the deadline for registration to March 3rd. I encourage all of you to take a few moments right now to go to the site for registration for the Poster Showcase .

The Spring 2023 STaRS event was one of the most memorable events of the year. An excited crowd of students, faculty, staff, campus leaders, and industry partners converged in the H-building to support SST’s showcase of faculty-led undergraduate research. It was a spectacular day! With your participation, I know this year’s event will be just as, if not more, successful.

I look forward to seeing you all for an exciting afternoon of science on April 11th!

Go Grizzlies!
