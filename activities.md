#### Electromagnets - 
Live link  

_Physics students have built electromagnets at home with nails, magnet wire and batteries.   The electromagnets varied in diameter, length and number of turns.  The maximum force of each electromagnet was measured by how many chained paperclips could be lifted._
* Fun Computer Games - Live link - _Students in ITEC 3450, Computer Graphic and Multimedia, create some fun computer games using the Processing language. This is one of their class projects. This project engages students in learning basic concepts and algorithms covered in the course and help them improve their programming skills._
* Vector Animation Demos - Live link - _Students in ITEC 2110, Digital Media, use Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop together to create vector animations. Each frame of the animation is a vector image. This is one of their class projects. Through this project, students learn basic concepts of digital images and how to use Adobe applications to create good quality vector animations._
* Building our own computer cloud from discarded hardware - Live link - _In-person demonstration at the H-1209 network lab, or virtual tour of the computer cloud that we constructed._
* Neurons in Action - Live link - _An interactive tutorial session teaching students about computational neuroscience and simulating neurons on a computer._
* Grizzly Hacks Coding Challenge - Live link - _Grizzly Hacks is a GGC student organization to promote coding activities on and off campus. We plan to hold a virtual activity that will include a training, followed by a hands-on coding challenge._
* Grizzlies On Air radio station - Live link - _Grizzlies On Air is a culmination of research involving a student focused radio station on the GGC campus.  Students will present their needs assessment, goals, vision, objectives, model design, marketing plan, and intervention strategy._
* What do mathematicians research? - Live link - _We will have presentations by GGC math major students on their current or previous undergraduate research. We will also have panel discussions on the experience of being a math major and career opportunities for math majors._
* Implementing a Data Science and Analytics Concentration at GGC - Live link - _This research will explain rationale and justification for the implementation of  a Data Science and Analytics (DSA) concentration within ITEC at Georgia Gwinnett College. It will further demonstrate how the DSA  curricula map is developed, and how it relates to the significance of providing DSA students with the pedagogy that pertains to their successful careers in Analytics and Big Data Science._
