Physics students have built electromagnets at home with nails, magnet wire and batteries.   The electromagnets varied in diameter, length and number of turns.  The maximum force of each electromagnet was measured by how many chained paperclips could be lifted.
#### * Fun Computer Games 
[Live link](https://ggc-edu.zoom.us/j/99038516176) - Time: 2pm - 3pm

Students in ITEC 3450, Computer Graphic and Multimedia, create some fun computer games using the Processing language. This is one of their class projects. This project engages students in learning basic concepts and algorithms covered in the course and help them improve their programming skills.
#### * Vector Animation Demos 
[Live link](https://ggc-edu.zoom.us/j/95078075830) - Time: 2pm - 3pm

Students in ITEC 2110, Digital Media, use Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop together to create vector animations. Each frame of the animation is a vector image. This is one of their class projects. Through this project, students learn basic concepts of digital images and how to use Adobe applications to create good quality vector animations.
#### * Building our own computer cloud from discarded hardware
