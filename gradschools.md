  <h2>✨Call for Graduate Schools participation✨</h2>

One of the main attractions for our undergraduates attending STaRS is the **Graduate and Professional School Fair** in which representatives from regional graduate and professional schools provide admissions and program information for students who seek to submit competitive applications.  Many of our students pursue post-graduate degrees after GGC, and we believe that they will be excited to hear about the Graduate Programs offered at your institution. Although the format will be a little different this year due to the current pandemic, this offers a unique opportunity to host representatives that would otherwise be limited by geographical distance.<br>

Thus, your participation at STaRS is a great opportunity for you to establish a strong presence on GGC's campus and market your programs to future GGC STEM graduates.  We invite you to take advantage of this opportunity to engage our diverse student body, raise their level of interest, and introduce them to your programs. To help defray the costs of the event, we are asking for a modest Registration Fee of $50.  The fee will grant you access to your own virtual room to interact with our many enthusiastic GGC students who are interested in your graduate programs. **To register your institution, visit this** [link](https://georgia-gwinnett-college-foundation-inc.square.site/product/grad-professional-other-attendee/38?cs=true&cst=custom) <br>

If you have any questions about the STaRS Graduate & Professional School Fair, please contact Dr. Sharon Keller (skeller6@ggc.edu). <br>
 
We hope to see you in April!
