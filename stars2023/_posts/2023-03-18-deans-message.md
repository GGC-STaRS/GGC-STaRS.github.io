Dear Colleagues,



Since arriving at GGC, I have heard so much about the tradition of the School of Science and Technology's annual, signature celebration of scholarship in the sciences:  STaRS.  I have seen photographs from past events, and I am excited to participate in my very first STaRS on April 14th.



As you all are aware, undergraduate participation in faculty-led research is one of the highest of high impact practices for students interested in pursuing a career in the sciences.  An important part of this experience is the presentation of the results of the student's research in a professional setting.  One of the important components of STaRS is the students' presentation of research posters.  This will be many of our students' very first opportunity to present the results of a significant amount of work to their teachers and peers, in a supportive and celebratory environment.  In addition, this represents our best opportunity to show campus leaders and colleagues in other disciplines the truly outstanding science that GGC students and faculty are doing every day.



This year is especially important, as this event will be the first live STaRS event that we will have held since the beginning of the COVID outbreak.



Because of all of these factors, I am asking each and every faculty member who has conducted research with students in the last few years to coax and cajole your students to present their research at STaRS.  We have plenty of space remaining to showcase your students' work, and the STaRS Committee has extended the deadline for registration to April 1st, and I encourage all of you to take a few moments right now to go to the site for [registration for the Poster Showcase](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1oUs-BtFuehzKeAHgObwVR8Y7j-2PYg9RtW9KiUjt3lg/edit?ts=620d5e44)



I look forward to seeing you all for an exciting afternoon of science on April 14th!



Go Grizzlies!
