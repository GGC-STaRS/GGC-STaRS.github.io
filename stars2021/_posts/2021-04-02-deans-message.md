Dear GGC family, 

As many of you may know, each year, the School of Science and Technology (SST) hosts its annual Science, Technology and Research Showcase (STaRS) in April. While the pandemic prevented us from hosting STaRS in April 2020, I am happy to announce that we are making a comeback in April 2021! Yes, our annual showcase of student research will be online this year on **Thursday, April 8th from 12-3 pm.** You will receive more details in an email from our STaRS committee that has worked tirelessly in collaboration with staff from across the campus to bring this event back in a new format. 

On behalf of SST and the STaRS committee, I invite you to join us online for STaRS. Meet with graduate and professional school representatives, gain new knowledge, and support your peers, students and friends. 

I look forward to seeing you all online. 

Sincerely, <br>
**Sonal Dekhane** <br>
Interim Dean, School of Science and Technology
